**Chessboard:**  
  
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8x8 grid, using  
newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there  
is either a space or a # character. The characters should form a  
chessboard.  
  Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:  
<pre>  
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
</pre>  
  When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding  
size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting  
a grid of the given width and height.

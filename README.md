  Background:  
    
  This repository is, mainly, intended for the purposes of self documentation. Unless otherwise stated, the programs  
  have been tested within gnome-terminal using node.js as an interpreter.  
    
  I claim no ownership over the book or any material contained there within. The problem/project contexts are quoted
  directly from the book, with some variation in wording in some cases. Please see 'Notice.txt' file for further
  information.

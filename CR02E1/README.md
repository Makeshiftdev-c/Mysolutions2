**Looping a Triangle:**  
  
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following  
triangle:  
<pre>  
#  
##  
###  
####  
#####  
######  
#######  
</pre>  
  It might be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by  
writing .length after it.  
<pre>  
let abc = "abc";  
console.log(abc.length);  
// -> 3  
</pre>
